# DLTTestBundle

The 'DLTTestBundle' project was generated by using the default-python template.

## Getting started

1. Install the Databricks CLI from https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html

2. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

	**Note:** This will require an acceess token you can create under:
	> /settings/developer/access tokens
 
4. Log into Databrics

	```
	databricks auth login --host <your host> --account-id <your account id>

	```
	
5. Verify connectivity:
	
	```
	databricks catalogs list
	```
	
6. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:

    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a job called
    `[dev yourname] DLTTestBundle_job` to your workspace.
    You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Workflows**.

4. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:

   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target <development, prod> --profile DEFAULT
   ```
	
   **Note:** You can list your profiles using the following command:
   
   ```
   databricks auth profiles
   ```	

   **Note:** The default job from the template has a schedule that runs every day
   (defined in resources/DLTTestBundle.job.yml). The schedule
   is paused when deploying in development mode (see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html).

5. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:

   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

6. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html.

7. For documentation on the Databricks asset bundles format used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.
